# Standard Hough Transform in Digital Image Processing
Application of Standard Hough Transform for straight-line detection in Digital Image Processing

This paper focuses on illustrating the core concept of the Hough Transform and its role in Digital Image Processing for detecting straight lines within an image. 

The mathematical discussion is complemented by a practical application implemented in Matlab: we utilize the Hough transform to extract gauge values from 16 images of a brake dynamometer, each displaying different values.
